Scripts to automate error-prone tasks and optimize data processing. These scripts are useful to ensure no human-errors occur on simple, recurring tasks. 

## [Automated - InternWorkbook.py](https://github.com/AGWeb18/BusinessIntel/blob/master/Automated%20-%20InternWorkbook.py)
- Instead of asking each student to submit their clinical metrics monthly, why not extract them directly?
- This script is being developed to calculate clinical metrics directly. 

## [cleveland_2018-2019.py](https://github.com/AGWeb18/BusinessIntel/blob/master/cleveland_2018-2019.py)
- This enhanced version now includes the intern's comments grouped and directly embedded in the script export.
- Previously, a secondary process of integrating the comments was required. 

## [fin_month.py](https://github.com/AGWeb18/BusinessIntel/blob/master/fin_month.py)
- Many times, human error is accountable for mistakes made when running simple reporting. 
- This script automates the calculation of each of the financial metrics to ensure consistency. 


##  [Scripts for Data Science](https://agweb18.github.io/)
- Useful Pandas/Python snippets for data science which include snippets which speed up development speed.
